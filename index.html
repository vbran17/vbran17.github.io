							<h2>Brandon Vaca</h2>
							<p>This website is made to advertise my work on True Crime through the mutliple media projects I have done on the topic. Through my work, I have found a organization I would like to give attention to. <a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a> is a non-profit organization that looks into criminal cases. Their goal is to exonerate the innocent through DNA testing and reform the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice. I recommend anyone who has gone through a legal battle to find out more information about them and see if you can employ their services. </p>
